This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Rich Text Editor POC

  

**Objective**: Understand which library provides the best solution in text editor

  
  

## DraftJs

  

-  [Official github page](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js)

-  [Best practices when working with draft js](https://reactrocket.com/post/draft-js-best-practices/)

  

## Quill JS

  

-  [Offical website](https://quilljs.com/)

-  [React Quill Library](https://github.com/zenoamaro/react-quill).

**Requirements:** 

 - [x] Typing text - text editor as normal (Insert, substitute, delete text characters), undo/redo, support copy paste
 - [x] Should support UTF-8 encoded languages
 - [x] Can interact with text - highlighting, clicking, additional styles, react component inside of the text
 - [x] Must support pins and events, other things nice to have
 - [ ] We can configure for right to left writing - The Documentation says it is possible, however, couldn't make it work on this project when using an Arabic keyboard.


**Official note from React Quill Library:**

> ReactQuill 2 is here, baby! And it brings a full port to TypeScript

> and React 16+, a refactored build system, and a general tightening of

> the internal logic.
